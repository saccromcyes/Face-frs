# Face frs
This project implements a real-time Face Recognition System built with Facenet-PyTorch, FastAPI, and Streamlit. The system detects faces from images or camera input, extracts deep embeddings using a pre-trained InceptionResnetV1 (VGGFace2) model, and matches them against a gallery of registered users based on cosine similarity.
